    "abstract": "\nOrganismal ageing is a biological process defined by a progressive loss of viability and an exponential increase in fragility. With the current advances in high-throughput technologies many of the molecular aspects of ageing can now be easily screened at various \u201comics\u201d levels (e.g.: genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, etc), using a wide range of models and starting from various hypotheses (e.g.: analysis of \u201cnormal\u201d ageing, long- and short-lived mutants, calorically restricted animals, etc). However, with relation to integration, the field of biogerontology, as it currently stands, is still missing a cohesive approach and is lacking an integrative view on how to combine all these molecular measurements. This project will use a systems biology approach to combine genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics data from various models of ageing in order to create a large-scale data-driven analysis and prediction platform for experimental interventions in gerontology. Using this platform, we first aim to analyze the multidimensional data in a holistic way, using network-based methods, in order to identify conserved and/or specific signatures of ageing. These common and complementary patterns will provide more insights into the mechanisms of ageing and offer the scientific community a data-generated knowledge base of the molecular actors (and their interactions), which play a role in lifespan determination. Next, we aim to test the performance of this computational platform in identifying new longevity regulators by validating its predictive power, first against a priori published results and then, in vivo, by testing lifespan and healthspan of C. elegans mutants under epistatic interventions. Lastly, we aim to build around the software platform and the generated knowledge base a web framework that allows users to access, analyze and build upon the data, in an efficient, easy-to-use manner, providing the scientific community with a suite of tools for guiding wet-lab experiments in gerontology.\n"

    "abstract": "\nThe Text2NeuralQL project primarily aims to build a solution for automatic generation of queries over structured databases (SQL) from texts written by users in natural language. To achieve our objective, we intend to use the latest advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. We will build a comprehensive solution that encompasses both a model based on deep neural networks, especially recurrent networks, to generate SQL queries from texts, and an interactive dialog agent used to resolve more complicated queries, which can not be determined unambiguously from the entered text (because they are incomplete, ambiguous). For training and validating the models implemented in the project, we will build a dataset which will contain a set of natural language annotations of several data queries, labeled by experts/programmers. Two different datasets will be created: the former based on mining of information from online sources (communities of practice, discussion boards, question-answering sites) and the latter using crowdsourcing platforms, either already developed or built within the project. The developed solution addresses especially users from large companies without programming knowledge (marketing, sales managers) and startups who cannot afford to pay a programmer to query their databases for generating reports. Although several solutions for generating queries from texts have been constructed, this is a perfect time to develop a viable product given the advances achieved in recent years, in similar NLP tasks, including automatic translation and question-answering tasks. Recurrent deep models, such as LSTM or sequence-to-sequence, provided substantial improvements for many natural language tasks and we aim to expand them to generate qualitative queries from texts.\n"

The projects are custom developments of Content Management Systems (CMS) and are written in Python or in PHP and customized to be rapidly deployed in the cloud and for their content to be accessible in all the 24 languages of the European Union. \r\nThe project we propose \"Semantic System for Managing and Recommending Tags in a Content Management System\" will facilitate the classification of the documents that are published in these CMS using tags that have semantic information attached. This has many benefits both for the ones that publish data and for the users that will find information easier.\r\nFrom the publishing point of view the authors will see recommended tags based on the content of the article. These tags can have different lexicalizations in the languages used in the CMS keeping though their semantics. The readers will be able to get the documents using the tag based classification using their preferred language. Now, usually the annotations are done using a single language most frequently English, even if the articles are translated in most of the languages of the European Union.\r\nThe project aims to analyze the existing technologies and to go further and identify the best technical solution both for annotating and for the discovery of the semantic relations and to build the bridge between these technologies and the CMS that are developed by the beneficiary.\n"

    "abstract": "\nIntegrated and comprehensive approaches in decision-making processes associated with the management of water resources are necessary in acute problems, triggered by direct or indirect human interventions in the natural systems within which we live. Water resources management requires the processing of a huge amount of information with different levels of accessibility and availability and in various formats. Often, the data acquisition needs to be acquired, transmitted and accessed in real time. Equally important is to have access to historical data for calibration and validation of the models. With regard to the accessibility of stakeholders to information, there are situations when information is to be accessed only by designated stakeholders, but there is a huge amount of information that is, and should be handled, as public information. The overarching goal of the proposal is to create an e-platform using advanced computational and communication technology for managing water and land resources in a sustainable and integrative manner, focused on pollution phenomena. The progress of information and communication technologies makes possible the access to relevant information and to provide feedback on the observed processes by means of e-services and ancillary data repositories. The multi-agent approach encompasses agent types with various behavior and specific interaction to the environment that are implemented as web-services. The specific objective is to implement a pilot platform for monitoring water pollution related phenomena and support to decision making in critical situation. Solving such water problems requires an interdisciplinary approach (hydrology, hydraulics, water quality, and ecosystem). The composite application framework will integrate existing software and new e-services compliant to Directive 2007/2/EC regarding metadata for spatial data sets, data series and data services for environmental resources, protection and conservation.\n"
