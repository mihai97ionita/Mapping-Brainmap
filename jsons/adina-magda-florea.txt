    "abstract": "\nThe \u201cIntegrated Solution for Innovative Elderly Care\u201d \u2013 INCARE project builds upon two successful platforms (AAL-NITICS and FP7-RAPP) a new readily available product whose seamless operability and modularity are demonstrated in extensive end-user pilots that help its fast uptake by the market. We start from previously validated user insights and use a co-creation approach to tune the INCARE solution. Extended pilots carried out in four different countries, i.e. Poland, Slovenia, Romania and Hungary, not only aid the development but also bring evidence about the effectiveness of the INCARE solution. At larger scale, our aim is to increase awareness and strengthen trust in the positive effects and huge potential of high-tech AAL solutions.\r\nINCARE offers a fully integrated solution that enables flexible, scalable and sustainable services to support elderly people with various backgrounds and age related impairments to self-manage their daily life, increase their sense of wellbeing, and prolong their involvement in the society while reducing the burden on their formal and informal caregivers. The INCARE solution goes beyond concatenation of functionalities by providing a seamless access of its users to a wealth of interconnected services with added functionalities.\r\nThe targeted TRL 7, together with a unique market proposition built upon the consortium experience and users\u2019 input, ensures market success and facilitates commercialisation of the INCARE solution within 2 years after the end of the project. EXYS, by exploiting its considerable experience in the AAL sector, leads the process of bringing the INCARE solution to the market. SOFTIC will contribute by offering software solutions that support successful IT and business strategies.\n"

    "abstract": "\nPeople with dementia are evidencing, already from the early stage of the illness, memory loss, episodes of confusion and space-time disorientation. The latter often happens in unpredictable ways, with consequences that sometimes can be very serious. With the progress of the disease, the escape and wandering can become symptomatic and recurrent events. Currently, the problem lies almost completely on the families, which without other solutions, often get to drastic measures, reducing patient\u2019s freedom. If this is not possible, caregivers live in a state of continuous stress. Location based services (LBS) have the potential to offer, at an affordable cost, useful help to both caretakers and caregivers. Motivated by this context, we propose to develop the IONIS by exploiting LBS, sleep quality monitoring, communication services in order to offer a wide range of dementia specific solutions through continuous support to people with dementia when they are at home (indoor area) or outside (outdoor area). A user-centered design involving extensive trials and piloting will be employed to both develop and validate the IONIS solution.\n"

    "abstract": "\nRobots have started to have a tremendous impact in economy and society through cost reduction of operations, increase of quality and conditions of work, assistance of people with special needs and, recently, client support and assistance in different domains.\r\nThe available technology at CITST on which this project is based, is the Tiago robot manufactured by Pal Robotics. Tiago is a mobile platform with manipulation, perception, manipulation and grasping abilities, and speech synthesis and understanding,. Tiago is an almost humanoid robot with a height of 146 cm and a weight of 75kg. CITST wants to exploit this robotic technology as a service offer for its potential clients. The envisaged scenarios are product promotion and/or clients\u2019 assistance in public places such as malls, museums, exhibitions, etc. If a certain company wants to promote a product or offer robotic assistance to its clients, CITST will personalize and adapt the actions of the robot to achieve the desired tasks or scenarios, and will lease the robot to this company. In this context, the main goal of this project is the design and implementation of a robotic platform to achieve integrated planning of Tiago tasks, command of the execution of defined tasks and monitoring of robots actions. Based on this platform, the robot activity must be easily configurable according to given scenarios and must allow multi-modal interactions with the client.\r\nThe successful achievement of the project objectives will have a significant impact for the CITST company. The immediate technical impact of the project is to offer the company an easy way to define and configure the robot for client support in different contexts. The possible future impact is to increase the number and nature of CITST robotic services with services that are autonomous, flexible and reliable, including services for persons with special needs.\n"

A clear separation of concerns between the main application functionality and contextual adaptation is needed.\r\nThus, the objective of this project is the creation of an open source context management middleware solution presenting rich features that alleviate context-aware application development.\r\nWork is based on an existing platform called CONSERT, recently developed in the AIMAS research group of UPB.  The current project improves upon CONSERT with: (1) performance improvement and modularisation of the reasoning engine to support applications of variable complexity requirements, (2) development of an integrated development environment (IDE) for context modeling and deployment to facilitate context-aware application programming based on the CONSERT Middleware, (3) advanced options for OSGi and Docker based deployments of CONSERT processing units to address dynamic change of context within an application (e.g. change of location, change of activity), and (4) development of two test applications: Smart Meeting Support for activity monitoring of students and teachers on a campus, and Smart Home User Support for adequate dynamic configuration of services offered in an ambient intelligence environment to assist users at home.\r\nAn open web-platform (CONSERT Store) will be setup where software components and configurations of CONSERT processing units can be shared by developers.\n"

    "abstract": "\nGiven the large number of elderly in the future, limiting the negative effects of non-adoption of ICT by future elderly (i.e.social exclusion) and stimulating the positive effects (which, on an aggregate scale might provide a solution for the financial problems related to the graying of the population), becomes an important task for public policies. In this context, the main goal of this project is to develop an elderly-friendly platform and associated tools for assisting elderly people to maintain a healthy lifestyle in their homes. By relaying on natural interaction devices (Kinect sensor) and natural user interfaces commanded by gestures, the platform will increase its chances of acceptability by the elderly community, thus addressing the perpetual problem of ICT for elderly. \r\nThe Mobile@Old platform will supervise elderly people in their homes, tracking their physical daily activities and supervising their vital signs (pulse, heart rate, etc), thus acting as a Personal Assistant (PA). One of the primary goals is to act as non-intrusively as possible while relying on modern technologies that will ensure its effectiveness. It will take an interdisciplinary approach making use of several novel techniques in artificial intelligence, image analysis, knowledge extraction, data fusion, agents applied in ambient intelligence applications correlated with medical and psychological issues.\r\nThe platform addresses age related issues beyond the simple physical fitness. Computer games may be able to contribute to delaying cognitive degradation-game mechanics and game dynamics are able to positively influence human behavior because they are designed to drive the players above the activation threshold (i.e. the upper right of the ability-motivation axis), and then trigger them into specific actions. However these games need to be tailored to the elderly, in game playing, interface and objectives.\r\nPA will extract a mobility pattern for each user and to generate remainders and alerts regarding to their physical and other daily activities. In case of low physical activity PA will advise the user to increase her/his level of physical exercise. The exercises will be performed interactively, as an adaptive game, specifically designed for elderly persons. The intensity level of the recommended physical exercises will be generated and adapted based on both vital parameters of the user (analyzed using a medical expertise) and also on his observed behavior by a team of psychologists. \r\nThe project will support maintaining health and functional capacity of older people and promote a better lifestyle and healthier for people based on the following components: \r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0VSM - Vital Sign Monitoring: performing analysis of vital signs using medical expertise and the observed behavior by interacting with a team of psychologists. \r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0PAT - Physical Activity Trainer: recommendation making exercise more, in case of detection of a low level of physical activity. These exercises will be carried out interactively as an adaptive game designed for the elderly; \r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The recommended exercises will be generated and adapted based on the vital parameters values obtained from different sensors, also based on the user behavior.\r\na recommended Exercise will be generated and adapted based on the values of various sensors monitor vital parameters and user behavior. The project is carried out by a multidisciplinary consortium composed of three universities and one SME with expertise in computer vision, artificial intelligence and ambient intelligence (UPB, Bucharest), user interfaces, web technologies and programming (UBB, Cluj Napoca), affective intelligence and pattern recognition (USV, Suceava), image processing and hardware development (small enterprise IT Center for Science and Technology SRL: CITST).  A team of psychologists and a physician from UBB and a kinetotherapist from USV will be part of the consortium.\n"
