    "abstract": "\nMore and more applications generate and handle very large volumes of data. In particular, this is true for Smart City applications, which attract a rapidly increasing interest from government, companies, citizens, developers, scientists, etc. Applications are fed with huge amounts of input data, in various formats, from a continuously increasing number of sources (sensors, governmental, regional, and municipal sources, citizens, public open data sources, etc.), and are describe by complex workflows that impose real-time processing for decision taking. DataWay project will develop generic principles, methods and algorithms encapsulated in a real-time processing platform for Big Data, which supports Smart City applications that will be gathered / routed / stored via mobile devices and processed / diffused via a more standard Cloud. The main scope of this platform is to extract valuable data to be used in real-time decision taking. We describe these data obtained by different techniques of data reducing, data cleaning, and data aggregation. DataWay platform will be connected to multiple streams of data, analyze data as flows and deliver data to a Cloud infrastructure. The validation of the proposed processing platform we will use applications that, based on pattern recognition and extraction, will assist transportation system in cities (e.g. traffic optimization) and crowd management (reliable communication, multimedia data sharing, path formation, message delivery, etc.).\n"

    "abstract": "\nE-services allowed transition from the punctual processes approach, in agriculture, in which each process was treated isolated, to the integrated approach, that allows the unified management of all processes. In this context, the agricultural greenhouse can be treated as a complex system, in which soil moisture, a decisive factor in plant growth is correlated with technical factors (other measured measures, type of crop, soil type, season, geographical location), with economic efficiency and the ergonomics of the farmer\u2019s workplace or the influences of other adjacent systems and phenomena (climatic, hydrological, access to expertise, legal regulations, etc.).  The overall objective of the proposal is to create an intelligent, integrated, cloud services-based system, using advanced computer technology, automation and communications to increase product quality and business development in the area of farming. The specific objective is to create an integrated control system for controlling the process in greenhouse crop production, using the services available on mobile devices. The services also offer simple and cheap integration of the existing infrastructure in various types of companies involved in agriculture. The added value generated by the system results from the creation of a virtual space that can be shared by several categories of companies:\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Agricultural farms, greenhouses particularly\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Companies providing information and training services to farmers\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Companies supplying equipment and agricultural materials, for modern technology-based  advertising for agricultural products, seeds, tools, etc..\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Associations of farmers, interested in a virtual environment for collaboration between farms / companies\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Other entities interested in working with listed categories (eg local/central government services)\r\nThe project increases the quality of agricultural products grown in greenhouses by combining several advanced cloud services used on the entire value creation chain.\r\nThe primary chain services provide real-time measurement of specific parameters (humidity, temperature, soil composition) and direct drive of watering equipment, depending on the specific culture of each lot.\r\nThe secondary chain services (support) provides:\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Setting up lots within the greenhouse to allow differential treatment depending on the culture;\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Information / training of farmers on the most appropriate methods / tools / techniques for cultivation of various crops:\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Commercial advertising, for suppliers of specific equipment and materials (seeds, fertilizers, tools specifically destined to be used in greenhouses);\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Liaison with local/central government, for rapid and efficient information of measures / regulations or situations of interest to farmers.\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Interoperability with platforms that monitor environmental conditions (meteorology, hydrology, pollution) to retrieve warning/alert messages.\r\nAll services are available on mobile platforms.\r\nThe project will end with an experimental model of the integrated system, which includes the cloud platform hosting the services, the system of sensors (the method of measuring the soil moisture is intended to be patented) and the driving system of the watering equipment.\r\nThe platform allows the connection of any type of automation device already installed in the greenhouse, by appropriate web service connector. If the farmer does not have such facilities, he will have to purchase only sensors that will be positioned in the appropriate places and actuators for watering and for accesing the services he will subscribe to the web service, which in turn will provide information in the desired format and will drive the watering equipment.\n"

    "abstract": "\nTraffic congestions are realities of urban environments, partly because road infrastructure capacities cannot cope anymore with the increase rate in the number of cars. This, coupled with traffic incidents, work zones, weather conditions, makes traffic congestions a major concern for municipalities. Advanced traffic control technologies may lead to more efficient use of existing road network systems, resulting in reduced traffic congestion, delays, local pollutant emissions, energy consumption and improved safety. The communication capabilities provided by modern mobile devices offer opportunities for the development of traffic control applications, where cars and devices within the road infrastructure collaborate to solve traffic problems that directly influence the quality of life. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), such as advanced traveller information systems, travel advisories, and others, attempt to relieve congestion and decrease travel time by assisting drivers on making informed decisions while driving, by selecting better routes, departure times, and even various modes of travel. The main drawback of current ITS platforms is their focused or limited set of solutions, and the inadequacy to support collaborative features. Due to such features it is often difficult or even impossible to introduce a new service from the scratch, since the required quantity of data hinders the quality of the service itself. We already experienced similar issues developing at UPB the Traffic Collector application. This is an experimental ITS application designed to support advanced ITS congestion and pollution control features. Unfortunately, the amount of data required to construct accurate traffic models acted as a barrier to a prototype implementation of the concept on city-level scales. \r\nHence, together with the BEIA\u2019s experience as an ITS integrator, MobiWay proposes the development of a collaborative platform designed to support ITS applications by acting as a middleware connection hub, offering an optimal support to different ITS partners and municipalities through and a data sharing and ITS support service integration platform. \r\nOur goal is to provide a platform of ecosystems, which allows engaging communities in exploiting the shared value of mobility and collaborative cultures that can be leveraged beyond the classical views of social networks, respectively the current trends of service creation. The project sets out a new vision for using mobile computing capacities for provisioning and support of ubiquitous connectivity and real-time applications and services for smart cities\u2019 needs. Data procured from highly distributed, heterogeneous, real and virtual devices (sensors, actuators, smart devices), in the range of millions, will be automatically managed, analysed and controlled by distributed services. The consortium will develop and demonstrate automatic procurement and management of ITS big data as a real-time cloud-based service in a scalable distributed cloud platform. A demonstration testbed will validate smart city scenarios for (a) business context and (b) societal context.\r\nThe project will generate new possibilities of extra value and improvement for already existing ITS solution providers by allowing them to share information and services with each other, besides their standard user base. As an example, daily mobility is better supported by choosing suitable traveling routes, given the data shared between multiple ITS platforms. Also it brings support for novel service ideas and initial development efforts by boosting up collaboration with mobility users and fostering participation in the ecosystem of services. Informing the user on energy and environmental impacts, and on eventual cost/price impacts to the user and to communities, may also lead to more sustainable decisions regarding the transport mode choice in the direction of a low carbon society.\n"

    "abstract": "\nThe goal of the project is to create a coherent, multidisciplinary, stakeholder-oriented and practical set of solutions for monitoring vulnerabilities induced in people, natural environment, infrastructure and assets by nuclear facilities, with a pronounced preoccupation for precautionary, anticipatory assessment and early warning. In essence, the system will forecast over an hourly-advancing time-window of 8 or more hours the potential exposure, radiological impact and need for countermeasures over the near-field (ca.25 km radius) and far-field (up to a few hundred kilometers) of a nuclear facility, entailed by virtual radioactive atmospheric releases and will aggregate the respective indicators according to appropriate metrics for grading the vulnerability (see DHS Risk Lexicon 2010 Edition - online) of the afore-mentioned targets on a stakeholder-intelligible scale, briefing responsible authorities on the situation forthcoming. To this effect, it will articulate in a logical flow analytic models of radiological assessment; conceptual models for quantitative risk/vulnerability assessment; and executable processes, all embedded in a knowledge, data, GIS and documentary resource canvas.\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The system endeavors to be in keeping with state of the art toolkits in radiological assessment of major risk responders, while featuring specific differences in (a) mindset: embracing the real possibility of severe accidents beyond the design basis, the probabilistic appraisal and operational history of the hazard sources; (b) ontology: a functionality and  structure emphasizing  the dynamic, fast-changing vulnerabilities in pace with weather and other variables; (c) coverage: a radiological engine accommodating various models of pollutant environmental dispersion; a geographic engine to cover on-the-fly virtually any location on the Planet; a meteorological engine forecasting real-time-fashion the model-relevant data from public, web-based sources; (d) a combination of standalone and web-based modi operandi conferring code operational safety;  and (e) a minimalist complexity observant to the \u2018point of diminishing return\u2019.  \r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mindful of the Law, regulations and the established national system of nuclear and radiological emergency preparedness and response (i.e. CNCAN-Romania, Nuclear Safety Basic Norms, NSR-1) the solutions will complement  the current capabilities by several innovative angles of approach and problem-solvers attuned to the international topical framework and good practices, on sound scientific foundations feeding from Physics and Fluid Dynamics; the Environmental Science; Geography; and Formal Sciences and IT&C engineering.\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While observant of the Romanian needs and specifics, the toolkit will also lend particular attention to the cross-border implications of the issues and will contemplate possible avenues to interoperation  with European platforms of similar vocation, seeking compliance with the EU policies (Council Directive 96/29/EURATOM and the Decisions and Regulations thereof).\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Relying on an alliance of an R&D national institute, a major technical university and a prominent private business enterprise, the project aims at developing and delivering an experimental model, code-named N-WATCHDOG, that may eventually (in a post-project phase) evolve into a marketable product. It will offer on-line/offline interactive facilities to various users, as well as analytical and warning services that may be automatically, or by appointment/subscription delivered to governance entities and, as custom-trimmed versions, to environment-awareness coalitions and the media. By its intrinsic educational features resting on, 'serious-gaming' simulation and visualization capabilities, the outcome-product may also contribute to improving Civil Society's 'soft power'  by offering technical and cultural requisites for a rational, balanced attitude towards the future of the Nuclear Power in the post-Fukushima World.\n"

    "abstract": "\nIntegrated and comprehensive approaches in decision-making processes associated with the management of water resources are necessary in acute problems, triggered by direct or indirect human interventions in the natural systems within which we live. Water resources management requires the processing of a huge amount of information with different levels of accessibility and availability and in various formats. Often, the data acquisition needs to be acquired, transmitted and accessed in real time. Equally important is to have access to historical data for calibration and validation of the models. With regard to the accessibility of stakeholders to information, there are situations when information is to be accessed only by designated stakeholders, but there is a huge amount of information that is, and should be handled, as public information. The overarching goal of the proposal is to create an e-platform using advanced computational and communication technology for managing water and land resources in a sustainable and integrative manner, focused on pollution phenomena. The progress of information and communication technologies makes possible the access to relevant information and to provide feedback on the observed processes by means of e-services and ancillary data repositories. The multi-agent approach encompasses agent types with various behavior and specific interaction to the environment that are implemented as web-services. The specific objective is to implement a pilot platform for monitoring water pollution related phenomena and support to decision making in critical situation. Solving such water problems requires an interdisciplinary approach (hydrology, hydraulics, water quality, and ecosystem). The composite application framework will integrate existing software and new e-services compliant to Directive 2007/2/EC regarding metadata for spatial data sets, data series and data services for environmental resources, protection and conservation.\n"
