    "abstract": "\nE-services allowed transition from the punctual processes approach, in agriculture, in which each process was treated isolated, to the integrated approach, that allows the unified management of all processes. In this context, the agricultural greenhouse can be treated as a complex system, in which soil moisture, a decisive factor in plant growth is correlated with technical factors (other measured measures, type of crop, soil type, season, geographical location), with economic efficiency and the ergonomics of the farmer\u2019s workplace or the influences of other adjacent systems and phenomena (climatic, hydrological, access to expertise, legal regulations, etc.).  The overall objective of the proposal is to create an intelligent, integrated, cloud services-based system, using advanced computer technology, automation and communications to increase product quality and business development in the area of farming. The specific objective is to create an integrated control system for controlling the process in greenhouse crop production, using the services available on mobile devices. The services also offer simple and cheap integration of the existing infrastructure in various types of companies involved in agriculture. The added value generated by the system results from the creation of a virtual space that can be shared by several categories of companies:\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Agricultural farms, greenhouses particularly\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Companies providing information and training services to farmers\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Companies supplying equipment and agricultural materials, for modern technology-based  advertising for agricultural products, seeds, tools, etc..\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Associations of farmers, interested in a virtual environment for collaboration between farms / companies\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Other entities interested in working with listed categories (eg local/central government services)\r\nThe project increases the quality of agricultural products grown in greenhouses by combining several advanced cloud services used on the entire value creation chain.\r\nThe primary chain services provide real-time measurement of specific parameters (humidity, temperature, soil composition) and direct drive of watering equipment, depending on the specific culture of each lot.\r\nThe secondary chain services (support) provides:\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Setting up lots within the greenhouse to allow differential treatment depending on the culture;\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Information / training of farmers on the most appropriate methods / tools / techniques for cultivation of various crops:\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Commercial advertising, for suppliers of specific equipment and materials (seeds, fertilizers, tools specifically destined to be used in greenhouses);\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Liaison with local/central government, for rapid and efficient information of measures / regulations or situations of interest to farmers.\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Interoperability with platforms that monitor environmental conditions (meteorology, hydrology, pollution) to retrieve warning/alert messages.\r\nAll services are available on mobile platforms.\r\nThe project will end with an experimental model of the integrated system, which includes the cloud platform hosting the services, the system of sensors (the method of measuring the soil moisture is intended to be patented) and the driving system of the watering equipment.\r\nThe platform allows the connection of any type of automation device already installed in the greenhouse, by appropriate web service connector. If the farmer does not have such facilities, he will have to purchase only sensors that will be positioned in the appropriate places and actuators for watering and for accesing the services he will subscribe to the web service, which in turn will provide information in the desired format and will drive the watering equipment.\n"
