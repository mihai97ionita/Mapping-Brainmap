In this project, we offer an ad-hoc, agile and reliable communication solution for both condition monitoring of the operations and safety of the workers in hazardous \u201eIndustry 4.0\u201f work environments in order to prevent unpredictable operation failures and work accidents. To reduce time to market and the barriers imposed by deployment cost, we explore how to blend technologies together into an open platform and repurpose some of the existent infrastructure. For this purpose, different kinds of IoT sensors, such as wearable devices, that capture data from work environment and vital parameters of work safety will be exploited which could extract maximum amount of information from the hazardous production sites. The proposed solution will focus on underground coal mines, tunnel/underground transportation / construction sites, waste management industries and manufacturing environments as the main application fields since these work environments are very good examples of hostile \u201eIndustry 4.0\u201f production sites where radio communication is very challenging. The aim is to improve safety, operation management and manufacturing environments and evaluate industrial accident risks more accurately owing to wearable sensors that collect information such as vibration and heat from worker equipment as well as ergonomic position of workers and gases like methane, firedamp and carbon monoxide. These sensors will also enable failure prediction for continuous operation, tracking of health status and physical location of workers which will guide search and rescue units in case of emergency. \n"

    "abstract": "\nLately, the introduction of ICT technologies in our daily tasks has opened up new pathways of cooperation and organization. Our society is evolving towards a new digital era in which citizens will become more and more connected to their surrounding environment. Cities are the core of our society and so they will need to embrace and support this evolution of their citizens. As a consequence of this process and thanks to new technological improvements, a considerable number of research projects and laboratory pilots have been deployed to study how to deal with problems such as traffic, pollution, mobility, energy consumption, etc. A complete digital ecosystem is growing within the smart city concept which has an estimated market worth of $1,134.84 billion by 2019. However, along with the variety of services, technologies and protocols being utilized in smart cities, service development and service deployment in the context of smart city monitoring and control is likely to be problematic for companies, city councils and citizens. The absence of a common platform with advanced services and tools for the smart city is hindering the effective development of the associated ecosystem. This type of ICT platform, also called the e-infrastructure, will be as important a regulator for the future development of cities as energy infrastructure and transport infrastructure have been in past decades. Under this context, CitiSim\u00b4s project main goal is devoted to the design and implementation of a new generation platform for the smart city ecosystem. This platform will provide a powerful monitoring and control infrastructure to enable planners to make critical management decisions on tactical and strategic levels based on the knowledge provided by the specific platform developed. For a natural interaction and better understanding of the events that happen in the city, 3D visualization techniques as augmented virtuality and augmented reality will be explored.\n"

In particular, this is true for Smart City applications, which attract a rapidly increasing interest from government, companies, citizens, developers, scientists, etc. Applications are fed with huge amounts of input data, in various formats, from a continuously increasing number of sources (sensors, governmental, regional, and municipal sources, citizens, public open data sources, etc.), and are describe by complex workflows that impose real-time processing for decision taking. DataWay project will develop generic principles, methods and algorithms encapsulated in a real-time processing platform for Big Data, which supports Smart City applications that will be gathered / routed / stored via mobile devices and processed / diffused via a more standard Cloud. The main scope of this platform is to extract valuable data to be used in real-time decision taking. We describe these data obtained by different techniques of data reducing, data cleaning, and data aggregation. DataWay platform will be connected to multiple streams of data, analyze data as flows and deliver data to a Cloud infrastructure. The validation of the proposed processing platform we will use applications that, based on pattern recognition and extraction, will assist transportation system in cities (e.g. traffic optimization) and crowd management (reliable communication, multimedia data sharing, path formation, message delivery, etc.).\n"

    "abstract": "\nE-services allowed transition from the punctual processes approach, in agriculture, in which each process was treated isolated, to the integrated approach, that allows the unified management of all processes. In this context, the agricultural greenhouse can be treated as a complex system, in which soil moisture, a decisive factor in plant growth is correlated with technical factors (other measured measures, type of crop, soil type, season, geographical location), with economic efficiency and the ergonomics of the farmer\u2019s workplace or the influences of other adjacent systems and phenomena (climatic, hydrological, access to expertise, legal regulations, etc.).  The overall objective of the proposal is to create an intelligent, integrated, cloud services-based system, using advanced computer technology, automation and communications to increase product quality and business development in the area of farming. The specific objective is to create an integrated control system for controlling the process in greenhouse crop production, using the services available on mobile devices. The services also offer simple and cheap integration of the existing infrastructure in various types of companies involved in agriculture. The added value generated by the system results from the creation of a virtual space that can be shared by several categories of companies:\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Agricultural farms, greenhouses particularly\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Companies providing information and training services to farmers\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Companies supplying equipment and agricultural materials, for modern technology-based  advertising for agricultural products, seeds, tools, etc..\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Associations of farmers, interested in a virtual environment for collaboration between farms / companies\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Other entities interested in working with listed categories (eg local/central government services)\r\nThe project increases the quality of agricultural products grown in greenhouses by combining several advanced cloud services used on the entire value creation chain.\r\nThe primary chain services provide real-time measurement of specific parameters (humidity, temperature, soil composition) and direct drive of watering equipment, depending on the specific culture of each lot.\r\nThe secondary chain services (support) provides:\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Setting up lots within the greenhouse to allow differential treatment depending on the culture;\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Information / training of farmers on the most appropriate methods / tools / techniques for cultivation of various crops:\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Commercial advertising, for suppliers of specific equipment and materials (seeds, fertilizers, tools specifically destined to be used in greenhouses);\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Liaison with local/central government, for rapid and efficient information of measures / regulations or situations of interest to farmers.\r\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Interoperability with platforms that monitor environmental conditions (meteorology, hydrology, pollution) to retrieve warning/alert messages.\r\nAll services are available on mobile platforms.\r\nThe project will end with an experimental model of the integrated system, which includes the cloud platform hosting the services, the system of sensors (the method of measuring the soil moisture is intended to be patented) and the driving system of the watering equipment.\r\nThe platform allows the connection of any type of automation device already installed in the greenhouse, by appropriate web service connector. If the farmer does not have such facilities, he will have to purchase only sensors that will be positioned in the appropriate places and actuators for watering and for accesing the services he will subscribe to the web service, which in turn will provide information in the desired format and will drive the watering equipment.\n"

    "abstract": "\nTraffic congestions are realities of urban environments, partly because road infrastructure capacities cannot cope anymore with the increase rate in the number of cars. This, coupled with traffic incidents, work zones, weather conditions, makes traffic congestions a major concern for municipalities. Advanced traffic control technologies may lead to more efficient use of existing road network systems, resulting in reduced traffic congestion, delays, local pollutant emissions, energy consumption and improved safety. The communication capabilities provided by modern mobile devices offer opportunities for the development of traffic control applications, where cars and devices within the road infrastructure collaborate to solve traffic problems that directly influence the quality of life. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), such as advanced traveller information systems, travel advisories, and others, attempt to relieve congestion and decrease travel time by assisting drivers on making informed decisions while driving, by selecting better routes, departure times, and even various modes of travel. The main drawback of current ITS platforms is their focused or limited set of solutions, and the inadequacy to support collaborative features. Due to such features it is often difficult or even impossible to introduce a new service from the scratch, since the required quantity of data hinders the quality of the service itself. We already experienced similar issues developing at UPB the Traffic Collector application. This is an experimental ITS application designed to support advanced ITS congestion and pollution control features. Unfortunately, the amount of data required to construct accurate traffic models acted as a barrier to a prototype implementation of the concept on city-level scales. \r\nHence, together with the BEIA\u2019s experience as an ITS integrator, MobiWay proposes the development of a collaborative platform designed to support ITS applications by acting as a middleware connection hub, offering an optimal support to different ITS partners and municipalities through and a data sharing and ITS support service integration platform. \r\nOur goal is to provide a platform of ecosystems, which allows engaging communities in exploiting the shared value of mobility and collaborative cultures that can be leveraged beyond the classical views of social networks, respectively the current trends of service creation. The project sets out a new vision for using mobile computing capacities for provisioning and support of ubiquitous connectivity and real-time applications and services for smart cities\u2019 needs. Data procured from highly distributed, heterogeneous, real and virtual devices (sensors, actuators, smart devices), in the range of millions, will be automatically managed, analysed and controlled by distributed services. The consortium will develop and demonstrate automatic procurement and management of ITS big data as a real-time cloud-based service in a scalable distributed cloud platform. A demonstration testbed will validate smart city scenarios for (a) business context and (b) societal context.\r\nThe project will generate new possibilities of extra value and improvement for already existing ITS solution providers by allowing them to share information and services with each other, besides their standard user base. As an example, daily mobility is better supported by choosing suitable traveling routes, given the data shared between multiple ITS platforms. Also it brings support for novel service ideas and initial development efforts by boosting up collaboration with mobility users and fostering participation in the ecosystem of services. Informing the user on energy and environmental impacts, and on eventual cost/price impacts to the user and to communities, may also lead to more sustainable decisions regarding the transport mode choice in the direction of a low carbon society.\n"
