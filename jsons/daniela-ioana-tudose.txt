    "abstract": "\nIt is proposed to develop a new class of composite materials: functional, hierarchical composites for structural applications. Mechanical properties of these materials will be enhanced by controlling the state and properties of interfaces between reinforcements and matrix at both nano and microscales. The engineered microstructure will also allow monitoring the state of damage while in service. Epoxy-based composites, which have a broad range of structural application in various industries will be considered. The need for epoxies with superior toughness is significant in applications in which vibrations are important (e.g. wind turbine and helicopter blades), in glues and other applications in the automotive industry. The consortium is a close collaboration between two academic partners and three industrial partners from Austria and Romania, with complementary expertise and with the capability to bring the proposed advances from the concept state to specific products.\n"
