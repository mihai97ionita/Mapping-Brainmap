    "abstract": "\nWe live in a fast developing and ever-changing world. Breakthrough advancements in deep learning, computer vision and computational power enable today\u2019s science to provide intelligent answers to the needs of our society. The capabilities of current artificial intelligence systems make people imagine and create smart applications in virtually all corners of human activity, impacting transportation, communication, entertainment, energy consumption and the natural environment. While many automated solutions seem possible, there are still plenty of challenging questions remaining. \r\nMain objectives: the Spacetime Vision project will find practical answers to these scientific challenges. We will push the frontiers of AI and take important steps towards making the technologies of tomorrow possible, with direct impact in various parts of industry, energy and the environment sectors. 1) We will create fast methods for online and unsupervised learning in large spatiotemporal volumes of data, able to function in the dynamic world. We will use different kinds of imaging and 4D (3D + time) sensing capabilities, ranging from fixed sensors to cameras present on UAVs. We will develop efficient methods for learning with no human supervision. Given the huge amounts of unlabeled data available and the costly manual annotation, unsupervised learning is crucial for the creation of new AI technologies. 2) We will make powerful methods for complete scene understanding, from the level of objects and their activities to translating the visual scene into natural language. Vision to language translation is a new topic in AI, becoming a new exciting field of research. 3) We will give drones the capacity to \u201csee\u201d and understand the world in which they fly. They will be smart and have the possibility to fly and land safely. 4) We will develop smart cameras with new sensing and learning capabilities. They will make our research suitable for real world applications.\r\nImpact: Our results will have immediate impact in different fields. We will orient our research towards the energy and environment sectors, in which there is a real need for performant AI technologies. While our scientific work will result in papers submitted to top IT conferences and journals, our experiments will include specific tests to answer the needs of our collaborators in the energy, industry and environment fields. Our approach to unsupervised learning in the 4D world and the results of our objectives will make a direct impact in the science and practice of artificial intelligence.\r\nRelation to the priority of the call: As our objectives state above, the Spacetime Vision project will answer important research questions in IT, with focus on Artificial Intelligence. At the same time, our tests will be relevant to the energy and environment fields. The project will create the basis for a solid long-term partnership between prestigious Romanian and Norwegian partners, who share many values, scientific and technological interest. It will lead to advancements that will benefit both parts, while strongly contributing to the growth of the Romanian research potential.\n"

    "abstract": "\nThe Text2NeuralQL project primarily aims to build a solution for automatic generation of queries over structured databases (SQL) from texts written by users in natural language. To achieve our objective, we intend to use the latest advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. We will build a comprehensive solution that encompasses both a model based on deep neural networks, especially recurrent networks, to generate SQL queries from texts, and an interactive dialog agent used to resolve more complicated queries, which can not be determined unambiguously from the entered text (because they are incomplete, ambiguous). For training and validating the models implemented in the project, we will build a dataset which will contain a set of natural language annotations of several data queries, labeled by experts/programmers. Two different datasets will be created: the former based on mining of information from online sources (communities of practice, discussion boards, question-answering sites) and the latter using crowdsourcing platforms, either already developed or built within the project. The developed solution addresses especially users from large companies without programming knowledge (marketing, sales managers) and startups who cannot afford to pay a programmer to query their databases for generating reports. Although several solutions for generating queries from texts have been constructed, this is a perfect time to develop a viable product given the advances achieved in recent years, in similar NLP tasks, including automatic translation and question-answering tasks. Recurrent deep models, such as LSTM or sequence-to-sequence, provided substantial improvements for many natural language tasks and we aim to expand them to generate qualitative queries from texts.\n"

    "abstract": "\nThe objective of MITSU (next generation MultImedia efficienT, Scalable and robUst Delivery) is to study and develop the next generation of multimedia streaming systems to be used over wireless networks. Market opportunities and pressure are pushing toward a very fast deployment of video solutions that are not interoperable together and that imply an increasing processing complexity. Video systems are entering into a new age where contents will have to be delivered to the user whatever the device or network he/she is using (i.e. with the network he/she is also currently connected to). While considering state of the art technologies in that field, MITSU intends to study and implement this video interoperability while minimising complexity and power consumption. Heterogeneous wireless environment, increases requests for retransmissions increasing bandwidth and energy and also creating inherent congestion on the network. New video consumption mode relying upon the use of smartphones and tablets have introduced new protocols (HTTP streaming), not interoperable between them and increasing the issue of data retransmission. New video codecs are also under development, providing more compression efficiency with increased complexity or targeting low complexity.\r\nMITSU will handle all of these evolution to propose robust, efficient and interoperable video streaming solution by studying and implementing the following key elements:\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MPEG HEVC video codec and its competitors\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Video streaming protocols and format interoperability\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Video transcoding and transrating\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Video quality metrics and probes\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robustness enhancement\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Context aware video streaming adaptation\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Management of heterogeneous networks\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cross-layer optimisation\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Privacy, security and content protection\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Latest generation of mobile phone communication system (4G)\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Multimedia and security application use cases implementation\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Field trials\r\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cloud Computing management \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n"
